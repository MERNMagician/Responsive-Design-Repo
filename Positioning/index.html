      In this demo you can control the position property for the yellow box.
    </p>
    <div class="boxes">
      <div id="red">This box is positioned relative</div>
      <div id="green">This box is positioned absolutely</div>
      <div id="blue">This box is positioned by fixed</div>
      <div id="black" style="color: white">This box is positioned sticky</div>
    </div>
    <p>
      To see the effect of sticky positioning, select the position: sticky
      option and scroll this container. The element will scroll along with its
      container, until it is at the top of the container (or reaches the offset
      specified in top), and will then stop scrolling, so it stays visible. The
      rest of this text is only supplied to make sure the container overflows,
      so as to enable you to scroll it and see the effect. Far out in the
      uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of
      the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance
      of roughly ninety-two million miles is an utterly insignificant little
      blue green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly
      primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.
